    summary: Overview of API design process at Slack. Interesting perspective that an OpenAPI specification document is a "prototype" for teams "so inclined" rather than being a mandatory design artefact.

    summary: Describes the security extensions to OpenAPI provided by Azure for use with HTTP triggers
    notes: There are bunch of different approach described here. Some of them ***would not*** be a good security implementation e.g. an API Key in a query string. A nice intellectual exercise, however.

    title: "Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers"
    date: 2021-10-12
    summary: A course to teach technical writers and engineers how to document APIs.
    notes: This has been around a good while but appears to have had a recent update. It provides a pretty comprehensive introduction if you're a technical writer (engineers would probably know more about OpenAPI that is included in the course, but who knows?)

    title: OpenAPI cures the symptoms, not the disease
    date: 2021-10-07
    summary: Zdenek's opinion on how OpenAPI (and other API specification languages and associated tooling) only treat the symptoms of poorly documented APIs.
    notes: This is written in an oped style and clearly serves to pique the readers interest in Superface. Still opinions are very useful as they pique our curiosity.
