# Content Archive

## Brief

The Stories repository serves a number of purposes with one being the capture, curation and publication of content on OpenAPI: articles, podcasts, videos, etc.

Clearly holding this kind of material in text files has limited value and will need to be render in something readable and searchable for normal human beings. However, its important to start capturing this collateral so this directory serves as a holding bay ready for publication.

The approach is bound to evolve over time. Expect refactoring :grimacing:.
